This layer was created by the OpenEmbedded devtool utility in order to
contain recipes and bbappends. In most instances you should use the
devtool utility to manage files within it rather than modifying files
directly (although recipes added with "devtool add" will often need
direct modification.)

If you no longer need to use devtool you can remove the path to this
workspace layer from your conf/bblayers.conf file (and then delete the
layer, if you wish).

Note that by default, if devtool fetches and unpacks source code, it
will place it in a subdirectory of a "sources" subdirectory of the
layer. If you prefer it to be elsewhere you can specify the source
tree path on the command line.
